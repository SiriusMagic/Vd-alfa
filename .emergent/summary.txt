The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a complex, futuristic vehicle UI for an electric Trophy Truck. The development followed an iterative, frontend-first approach, primarily using React, Shadcn UI components, and mock data. Key phases involved building the core dashboard, then progressively adding advanced systems like dynamic suspension, bionic cooling (with a detailed flow diagram), intelligent vehicle controls, comprehensive comfort features, advanced driving functionalities, various traction modes, autonomy calculations, renewable energy harvesting (TreeR), and a drone-based reconnaissance system. The engineer demonstrated strong adherence to user requests, rapidly translating conceptual ideas into interactive UI elements, and consistently using the screenshot tool to verify progress. The work is currently focused on refining the newly integrated reconnaissance system, with a known tooltip error requiring immediate attention. Backend integration remains a future task, awaiting explicit user confirmation, as the user continuously requested new frontend features.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to create a conceptual UI design for an electric Trophy Truck. The application should initially be a functional frontend-only MVP with mock data. Key features include:
1.  **Driver Controls**: Select FWD, RWD, AWD (with adjustable power distribution per axle), independent voltage/amperage control for four motors, and save configurations.
2.  **Dashboard**: Real-time display of speed, torque, battery state (percentage, temperature), and vehicle attitude (G-force, pitch, roll).
3.  **Dynamic Suspension**: Adjustable height and rigidity (front/rear), with preset modes (Rock Crawling, Baja, Asphalt).
4.  **Situational Awareness**: Thermal/night vision, 3D LIDAR topographical map, real-time chassis monitoring.
5.  **Driving Modes**: Attack/Defense profiles (Rampage, Ghost, Sentinel) and Virtual Transmission (gears prioritizing torque or speed, with custom adjustability). Emergency modes like Overdrive and Aggressive Regeneration.
6.  **Diagnostics**: Detailed health monitoring for motors and battery packs, plus an effort history.
7.  **Intelligent Vehicle Systems**: Automated spoiler control, door/trunk management, screen organization, user profiles (seats, mirrors), voice commands, and a Welcome Ritual.
8.  **Comfort & Advanced Driving**: Rain sensor, heated/massage seats (multi-position, zero gravity), sunroof control (ventilation, blinds), dimmable windows, variable ratio steering, torque vectoring, integrated solar panels for energy generation, and modular driving (manual, assisted, autonomous).
9.  **Dedicated Sections**: Separate interfaces for Tracción (7 distinct 4x4/AWD modes), Autonomía (range calculation based on battery, efficiency metrics), TreeR (renewable energy harvesting from photovoltaic, thermal, and piezoelectric sources), and Reconocimiento (drone deployment, LIDAR mapping, object alerts, drone battery energy transfer to car).
All implementations are frontend with mock data, with an explicit request to avoid backend for the Autonomía section. The design emphasizes a futuristic, elegant, and sporty aesthetic with micro-animations and advanced UI patterns.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the React application, establishing  for routing. It orchestrates the rendering of the entire vehicle UI.
    -   **Changes**: Initially contained a simple API call. It has been extensively modified to import and integrate numerous vehicle system components, likely acting as a wrapper for  or handling top-level routing for the entire application.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This file likely serves as the primary layout and navigation component, housing the tabbed interface that switches between different vehicle systems (Dashboard, Suspension, Cooling, etc.).
    -   **Changes**: Continuously updated throughout the development process to include new feature components and manage their visibility within the UI. It now imports components like , , etc., dynamically rendering them.
-   ** (e.g., , )**:
    -   **Importance**: Each file represents a distinct, complex feature or system within the vehicle UI. They encapsulate specific functionalities, manage local mock data, and handle user interactions.
    -   **Changes**: These are newly created files, each containing detailed frontend logic, UI elements (sliders, buttons, diagrams), and dynamic data visualization (e.g., animated flow, real-time metrics) for their respective systems. All data is currently mocked.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A specific sub-component responsible for rendering the interactive 2D diagram of the bionic cooling system's vascular network.
    -   **Changes**: Created to visualize the user's request for a real-time, color-changing flow diagram of the cooling system, including animated particles.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The FastAPI backend application, configured with CORS, MongoDB connection, and basic  CRUD operations.
    -   **Changes**: Minimal changes throughout the trajectory, as the development has focused almost exclusively on the frontend, with backend implementation deferred pending user's go-ahead.

<pending_tasks>
-   Fix the Tooltip error in the newly integrated  component.
-   Address recurring ESLint parsing errors identified during file write operations (e.g., in ).
-   Implement backend functionality for all the developed frontend features, once explicitly requested and confirmed by the user.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating the Reconocimiento (Reconnaissance) system into the main vehicle interface. This involved creating the  component, which includes features for opening a roof hatch, deploying drones (1, 2, or all), performing reconnaissance and mapping, displaying alerts for detected objects (people, cars, motorcycles), and a slider to transfer energy from drone batteries back to the car. The component was integrated into the main . A screenshot confirmed its successful display. However, the last action indicates an identified Tooltip error within this newly implemented system that needs to be resolved, alongside previously noted ESLint parsing errors during the file writes for this component.
